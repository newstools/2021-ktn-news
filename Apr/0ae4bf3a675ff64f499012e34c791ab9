Kenya's cooperative bank has secured 10 million u.s dollars under the eco. business fund. the subordinated loan will be on-lent to sustainable agribusinesses, contributing to the fund&rsquo;s mission of conserving biodiversity, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, and mitigating and adapting to climate change. the investment will provide much-needed financing for businesses to enhance sustainable measures in their agricultural practices, particularly important in light of the challenging operating environment created by the covid19 crisis. commercial lending to the agricultural sector remains disproportionally low. through this new investment, the eco. business fund and coop bank will provide necessary credit to sustainably certified agribusinesses, such as those in the coffee, tea, and horticulture sectors, Kenya's main agricultural exports. by financing green measures such as solar and hydroelectric installations for tea factories that reduce reliance on fuelwood, and cold storage solutions that reduce postharvest losses, the partners hope to boost sustainable production practices and conserve the unique ecological landscape of the country.
