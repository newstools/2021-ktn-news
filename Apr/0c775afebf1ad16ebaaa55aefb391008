The Kenya purchasing manager`s index dropped to its lowest for nine months in March, as private sector companies reported only a marginal expansion in output and a slowdown in new order growth as cash flow issues limited customer spending. Employment numbers increased only modestly, while inventories rose at the slowest rate in the current growth sequence. Rising fuel prices meanwhile led to another sharp uptick in purchase prices; driving further pressure on firms' margins. The headline Pmi fell for the second month running in March, from 50.9 in February to 50.6. The latest reading pointed to just a marginal improvement in the health of the private sector, and the weakest seen since the recovery in economic conditions from the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic began last July.
