On Thursday, February 20th, 2020, DCI director George Kinoti revealed to the country that the body found at villa Franca estate in Imara Daima, here in Nairobi was that of sergeant Kipyegon Kenei &ndash; an officer attached to the office of the deputy president, who had been missing for two days. The discovery of the body would soon open a rift between Kinoti and the deputy president. A rift that led to both men making lofty promises to Kenei&rsquo;s family in the days that followed his death, promises that to date are yet to be kept. KTN senior reporter Duncan Khaemba revisits the Kemei murder probe, one year on.
