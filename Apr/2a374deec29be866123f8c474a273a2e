Approximately two-thirds of flamingoes from lake Nakuru have been displaced from the lake to neighboring lagoons such as sewages following the rising levels of water in the lake. This displacement is posing a risk to the birds as it exposes them to toxic food from the sewage waste. The latest plight facing the birds coming at the height of yet another danger facing the birds at lake Bogoria, where the increase in water levels has pushed the birds into the traps of the lethal mathenge tree where they have been dying in the hundreds.
