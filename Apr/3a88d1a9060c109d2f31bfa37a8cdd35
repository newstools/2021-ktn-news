persistent high production and a global oversupply have pushed down the average tea prices for factories managed by Kenya tea development agency to Kenya shillings 239.40 in the nine months to March 2021, a 12% drop. the high tea production in Kenya is majorly a result of favourable weather conditions during the period, besides the rapid expansion of acreage under tea over the years. KTDA and other regional producers have been grappling with poor prices over the last three years as global oversupply, high production, and economic weaknesses in key market countries exert pressure on the tea trade. the agriculture and food authority (AFA) has cited the covid19 pandemic as a major driver to the continued price depression. additionally, the huge amount of stocks and high production continue to exert pressure on prices but expects the amount of tea coming from factories to ease up this year. a global oversupply of the beverage coupled with market disruptions from the covid19 pandemic has seen prices continue on a downward trend for a third consecutive year since the 20182019 financial year.
