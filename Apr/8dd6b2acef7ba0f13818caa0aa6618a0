Members of the bicameral parliament remain divided tonight on the contentious question on whether parliament has powers to make changes on the constitutional amendment bill 2020 which was initiated through a popular initiative. during a special sitting in both houses, it emerged that those who are adamant that the bill has inconsistencies and might be unconstitutional want the bill amended while proponents of BBI say their hands are tied and can not be altered in any way. and as chris thairu reports, both the senate and the national assembly have 2 reports for the majority and minority members.
