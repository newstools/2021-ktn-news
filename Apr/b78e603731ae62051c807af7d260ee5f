Kenya&rsquo;s mineral sector has the potential to lift the country's economy significantly if resources are well harnessed. according to outcomes of a webinar by Madini Kenya Kenya's mining industry was not affected by the pandemic but instead had a boom which caused the price of gold to rise to an all-time high in eight years. according to the mineral rights board chairman Stephen Kuria, despite having the capacity to contribute up to eleven per cent of the countries GDP, mining only contributes about one per cent, with the legal industry being predominantly run by only two companies, Magadi soda and base titanium. currently, mining contributes about sixty-seven billion shillings to the countries GDP with one point three billion shillings for investments, two billion shillings in taxes, one point six million shillings in royalties paid and Twentynine billion shillings in primary sales. according to Kuria Kenya was ranked at position ninety out of ninety-one in mining jurisdictions in terms of attractiveness to mineral investment largely due to lack of data.
