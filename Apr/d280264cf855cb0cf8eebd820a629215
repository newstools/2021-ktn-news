Kenya has reacted angrily to a move by the United Kingdom to ban all travels to and from Kenya to the country over covid -19 fears. A strongly worded statement from the ministry of foreign affairs says the move by the United Kingdom was regrettable as it will have far reaching consequences on bilateral ties between the two nations. It cited trade, tourism and security cooperation between Kenya and UK. The Kenyan government says it has noted with regret what it called vaccine apartheid where vaccine producing nations are now practicing vaccine discrimination as well as hoarding.
