We will not subject Kenyans to higher electricity prices. this was the commitment made by power utility firm Kenya power as it held its annual general meeting. the company indicated it would try to turn around its operations without loading more costs on consumers. Kenya power chairperson Vivienne yeda told shareholders that though the firm was not yet out of the woods, it had made progress over the recent months through measures such as cost-cutting and sealing loopholes that have enabled siphoning of money in the past. Kenya power posted a massive loss after tax of 939 million shillings for the period ending December 2020. this compared to a profit of 262 million shillings in 2019. the power distributor says the covid19 pandemic in the second half of the year affected demand thereby reducing sales.
