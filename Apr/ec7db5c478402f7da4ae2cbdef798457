In a bid to step up power supply in the counties, the Kenya electricity transmission company ketraco has powered&nbsp;kitui town and its environs. The new power line is expected to receive reliable and stable power supply following the energization of the 132kv mwingi ? kitui transmission line and the 132/33kv kitui substation. The&nbsp;line section is part of the greater 153km 132kv mwingi ? kitui ? wote ? sultan hamud transmission line. Kitui town, which is strategic to the lower eastern region, had no direct transmission line forcing the region to depend on 33kv distribution feeders from mwingi and kindaruma substations. With the replacement of the long 33kv lines that were susceptible to faults that resulted in power outages, kitui and surrounding areas will now experience reduced power outages and an increased reliability of supply.
