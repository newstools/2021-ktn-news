ODM party leader Raila Odinga has indicated that he has no interest or plans to appeal the ruling from the court of appeal on the building bridges initiative (BBI) bill in case the decision is not in their favour. Odinga indicated that instead of concentrating on appeals, their focus will be to prepare for the 2022 general election. This statement coming hours before a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta at state house Mombasa together with other political leaders Kalonzo Musyoka, Musalia Mudavadi, Gideon Moi and Moses Wetangula in a bid to craft a formidable team that will eventually face deputy president William Ruto at the ballot. And as Chris Thairu reports, the main challenge still facing the opposition leaders is who among them will be their presidential flag bearer.
