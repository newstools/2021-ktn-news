Independent Electoral And Boundaries Commission IEBC has published contributions as well as&nbsp;spending limits for candidates who will be vying in next year's general election. A presidential candidate will be allowed to spend a maximum of KSH. 4.4 billion while gubernatorial, senatorial, and county woman representatives, will spend varying amounts depending on the region. Those vying in&nbsp;Turkana county will spend the highest amount of Ksh. 123m while candidates in Lamu will spend the lowest amount being Ksh. 21m.&nbsp;While IEBC notice may be a big relief to some candidates, the proposals will most likely face resistance given that the same must receive a parliamentary nod&nbsp;before its adoption.
