Tonight, President Uhuru Kenyatta has nominated four commissioners to fill the vacant positions at the independent electoral and boundaries commission. The president has nominated Francis Wanderi, Justus Abonyo, Juliana Cherera and Irene Cherop for IEBC commissioner slots. The names have already been submitted to parliament where the justice and legal affairs committee will vet them and either approve or reject. The four will fill the vacant positions left after the resignation of Roselyn Akombe, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Connie Maina. The national assembly is expected to vet the four and table a report within 28 days. If approved, the IEBC will be fully constituted after three years of operating with just the chairman and two commissioners.
