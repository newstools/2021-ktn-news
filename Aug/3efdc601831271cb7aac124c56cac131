The government has extended the period for reporting and admission for form one student for one more week. In a letter to all regional and county directors of education, the director for secondary education at the ministry of education, paul Kibet, says the decision has been necessitated by the need to realise 100% transition. The directive comes just a day after the chief administrative secretary in the ministry of education, Dr Sara Ruto, said day secondary schools were recording low reporting rates for form one students.
