It is now 23 years since the tragic bomb blast that hit Nairobi on the morning of 7th august 1998. But for the victims of the bomb blast, events of that day are still vivid. More than 200 lives were lost and thousands of people injured. And as the commemoration was being held here in Nairobi at the memorial peace museum, our reporter Timothy Otieno caught up with a young lady who witnessed a tragedy just as she had turned two years, with the bomb exploding metres away from her while her mother tightly held on to her baby. We&rsquo;d like to caution our viewers that some of the images used in this report could be disturbing.
