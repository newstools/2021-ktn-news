The roadmap to the formalization of the One Kenya Alliance as a coalition ahead of the 2022 general election enters a critical stage tomorrow, as Amani National Congress, Wiper, and Ford Kenya members of parliament convene a joint parliamentary group meeting to discuss key issues in the formation of the alliance. The meeting comes amid recent remarks by ODM Party Leader Raila Odinga that he too does not rule out the possibility of working with the team in the 2022 polls.
