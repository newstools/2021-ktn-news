More than one million form one students are set to start their high school education, beginning this week. Many have found themselves disadvantaged after they were denied admission. According to Nicholas Maiyo, chairman of the Parents' Union in the country, many parents were forced to buy school uniforms from select shops approved by the school, while some students were denied opportunities because of the marks they scored in the National Examination.
