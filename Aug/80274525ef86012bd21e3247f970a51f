Proper hygiene and sanitation have been a challenge in several parts of the country for years. In a bid to curb this, UNICEF Kenya, the ministry of health, and other partners have launched the Kenya sanitation week which began on the 9th of this month and ends on the 13th. The theme for this year&rsquo;s sanitation week is &lsquo;focused on open defecation.
