The standard group will continue to embrace partnerships with different sectors to drive economic growth. Chief executive officer Orlando Lyomu says the Standard Group has been in forefront of championing education issues in the last 5 10 years ago. He says this has enabled the government to address the challenge of low enrolment in the technical and vocational training institutions (TVET). He added that the group will continue to support TVET institutions as an engine of growth in the country noting that there was an immense opportunity in the sector. He was speaking during a meeting with senior officials at the Kenya coast national polytechnic (KCNP) led by chief principal Mrs Anne Mbogo.
