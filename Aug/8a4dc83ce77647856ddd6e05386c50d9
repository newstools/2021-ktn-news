5,000m runner Nicholas Kimeli might be Kenya&rsquo;s long ranger in the final set for Friday, but he seems ready to bag the elusive gold medal in Tokyo. Kimeli won his heat on Tuesday in 13 minutes 38.87 seconds while his compatriot Daniel Simiu failed to recover from a fall with six laps remaining only managing to finish in 10th place.
