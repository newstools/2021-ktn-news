Once again, traders operating their businesses at the famous Gikomba market in Nairobi are counting losses after a mysterious fire destroyed their property running into millions of shillings. Over 300 traders were affected by the fire that started early morning today. Top national government officials led by interior PS Dr Karanja Kibicho visited the scene of the fire and promised those operating their businesses there that the government was fast tracking construction of phase two of the Gikomba market. Kibicho said once complete, the new market would accommodate more traders operating in open spaces adding that the market was well equipped to handle fire incidents. The cause of the early morning inferno has not been established.
