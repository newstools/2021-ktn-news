Supremacy battles pitting Law Society of Kenya president nelson Havi and embattled CEO Mercy Wambua escalated today at the body's head office disrupting operations. Drama ensued when some staff members were denied access to the office, at some point forcing police to use force to open the main gate. Following the incident, a visibly angry Havi accused police of interfering with the internal affairs of the lawyers' body.
