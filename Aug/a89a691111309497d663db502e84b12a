The national super alliance NASA, lifeline could be extended albeit for a few more days following renewed wrangles pitting two factions that are seeking control of Ford Kenya party which is one of the former affiliate parties. The Wafula Wamunyinyi led faction has today faulted a move by Moses Wetangula group to exit from the NASA coalition claiming proper procedures had not been followed. The move now leaves NASA technically alive since ODM had not written to the registrar of political parties to pull out. Emmanuel too reports on a move that is a threat to the ongoing coalition building.
