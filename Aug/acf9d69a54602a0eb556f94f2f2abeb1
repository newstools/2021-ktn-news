Anger and protests were witnessed in the Kianjokoma area, Embu county today following the mysterious death of two brothers who had earlier been arrested by police for allegedly flouting curfew rules. One person has been shot dead following the chaotic protests. And as anger rose over the twin murders, top police chiefs from Nairobi visited the family in Embu and announced changes in the local police service in a bid to stem further protests. And as Moige William reports, several police bosses working in the area have been shuffled.
