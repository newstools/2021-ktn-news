Signs are now clear that the National Assembly will outrightly reject the newly gazetted election regulations and campaign financing proposals presented by the electoral body IEBC. MPs are unhappy over the proposals by IEBC terming them time barred. Today, the committee on delegated legislation held a session with IEBC commissioners led by their chairman Wafula Chebukati where they told IEBC it was unlawful for them to gazette the regulations without seeking the approval of parliament as required. IEBC on its part has accused parliament of failing to table the campaign financing bill presented to them in august 2020
