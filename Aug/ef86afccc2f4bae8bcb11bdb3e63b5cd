The families of four men who were last week lynched by villagers in Enkamuriak Village, Kajiado, on suspicion of being livestock thieves have called for speedy investigations and arrest of their assailants. Speaking at their Karamton village in Nyandarua County, the families have called for justice for the two brothers and their cousins. They were speaking during burial preparations for the two brothers Freddie Wanjiru, 30, and 25-year-old Victor Wanjiru. The relatives have maintained that their children were innocent and were victims of mistaken identity. Their aging grandmother said that one of her grandchild (Freddie) was running a graphic and design shop in Nairobi while victor was in charge of their mother's construction site and estate in Syokimau where they were also living.
