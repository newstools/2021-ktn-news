Tonight, the court of appeal hearing the BBI appeal case has said it will deliver its judgment on the 20th of august despite appeals by some appellants for it to be delivered earlier. Justice Daniel Musinga said the date had been arrived at after considering the nature of the case and documents submitted to the court. Musinga made the announcement during the final day of submissions that saw lawyers for respondents once again target president Uhuru Kenyatta. One of the lawyer&rsquo;s Dr John Khaminwa told the court of appeal not to listen to President Kenyatta&rsquo;s appeal citing his numerous disregard of court orders as well as failure to appoint judges.
