Two judges of the high court justice Said Juma Chitembwe and Aggrey Muchelule can now breathe a sigh of relief, after obtaining orders to stop their arrest and prosecution in court. This came on a day the police came under heavy criticism over yesterday&rsquo;s incident in which they arrested the two judges before releasing them. Meanwhile, the chief justice Martha Koome has said her office was not notified about the arrest of the two judges.
