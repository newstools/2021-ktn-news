Tonight, let&rsquo;s start with politics of Mt Kenya and a section of leaders from the region held a meeting in Meru today and vowed to stop external forces from dividing them ahead of 2022 general election. The leaders who were led by cabinet secretary peter Munya and Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui said the Kiambaa parliamentary by election result should be an eye opener that threatens their bargaining power at the national level. The leaders who also included Kirinyaga governor Anne Waiguru announced plans to either revamp the jubilee party or find an alternative political outfit to use in 2022. And as Allan Ochanda reports, most of the elected leaders from Meru gave the meeting a wide berth signaling divisions in the mountain.
