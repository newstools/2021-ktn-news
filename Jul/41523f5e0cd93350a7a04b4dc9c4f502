President Uhuru Kenyatta is set to visit the rift valley region this month to launch several development projects. The visit to deputy president William Ruto&rsquo;s political backyard also comes amidst a growing rift between the president and his deputy following ODM leader Raila Odinga&rsquo;s handshake with the president in march 2018. The tour is expected to come two and a half years since the head of state launched the Rift Valley textile, Rivatex Company. Already expectations are high, as the much-anticipated trip gets closer.
