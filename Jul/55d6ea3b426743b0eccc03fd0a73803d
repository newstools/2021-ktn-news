Prehistoric Maumau town in Budalangi has become a ghost town for more than a year now after its former residents were displaced by flooding caused by lake Victoria's backwash. The town is well known for hiding Mau Mau warriors from the central region who fled their jails in lake victoria island jails during colonial rule.
