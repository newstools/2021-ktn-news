7 years ago, KTN met an 18 year old girl living on the streets of Nairobi who had just given birth and was desperate for help. The story of Jedidah Kawera is one which moved the masses and further highlighted the plight of the homeless in the country.

And as KTN&rsquo;s Timothy Otieno now reports, her wish to go back to school and graduate was realized just a few hours ago bringing to conclusion several years of pain, hard work and utter dedication.
