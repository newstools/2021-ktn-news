Five men were arrested last night in Nairobi&rsquo;s OTC area as they attempted to drill their way into a building that houses a bank. Police say the five had rented four rooms in a guest house located next to the bank with a mission of stealing money in the dead of the night. Police acting on a tip off pounced on the five suspects and arrested them just before they broke into the building housing the bank.
