A section of leaders from Baringo county has today torn into deputy president William Ruto's presidential bid stating that Ruto's was a personal venture and not intended to benefit the country. Speaking after a closed-door meeting with KANU chairman Gideon Moi, the leaders stated that Ruto's past punctuated by corruption allegations was not good for the community. They further declared their unwavering support for senator Moi, stating that he was the only assurance for the region to have a stake in the current and subsequent governments. They also weighed in on president Uhuru Kenyatta's impending visit to the region, stating that they will welcome him, having seen the benefits that the government has done in the region. Gideon who had earlier in the day attended mass at the holy cross catholic church in Mogotio, had on Saturday challenged allies of deputy president William Ruto to join his bid if they were to stop complaining of being sidelined by the government.
