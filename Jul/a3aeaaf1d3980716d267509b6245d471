Baringo senator Gideon Moi has challenged allies of deputy president William Ruto in Baringo county to join his bid and reap from benefits of being in government. Moi said that whereas a section of leaders from the county was complaining of being sidelined, he remains in a position to link them with the power and benefits that come with it. The senator was speaking in Eldama ravine during the burial of Len Bomet, a retired major who died at the age of 49
