Interviews for the vacant IEBC positions began on the wrong footing after one candidate withdrew at the last minute over forgery allegations touching on his academic papers. Abdalla Mohamed who was to appear before the IEBC selection panel as the first interviewee opted out after he was informed that the Kenya Methodist university confirmed he never acquired his degree from the institution. Following the revelations, the selection panel has asked investigative agencies to probe the matter. Meanwhile Dr. Abdirizak Arale Nunow also appeared before the selection panel where he was taken to task over his role as a commissioner in the defunct constitution of Kenya review commission.
