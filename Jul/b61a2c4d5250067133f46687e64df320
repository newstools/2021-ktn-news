1,649 members of the Shona community have been fully recognized as Kenyans after they were issued with national identity cards in an event that was graced by interior cabinet secretary Fred Matiang&rsquo;i. This brings to an end a long drawn fight by this community to be recognized as citizens, more than 50 years since their forefathers settled in the country as missionaries on the invitation of founding president mzee Jomo Kenyatta.
