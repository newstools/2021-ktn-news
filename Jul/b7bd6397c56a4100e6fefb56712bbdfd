The church has added its voice to the move by parliament to amend the constitution. The national council of churches of Kenya, NCCK, says that parliament should not initiate what it terms as peace meal constitutional amendments. This follows the call for public participation on the constitution of Kenya amendment bill 2020. The bill seeks to among other things allow the president to appoint cabinet secretaries from among members of parliament. The NCCK which held a 2 day consultative meeting at the jumuia conference and country home in Limuru has also warned politicians against creating loopholes to allow the postponement of next year&rsquo;s general election.
