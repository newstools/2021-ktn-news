The Kenya national union of teachers, KNUT, the head office has been closed indefinitely after auctioneers raided it and carted away all office equipment and furniture worth over 1.4 million shillings owed to a former employer. Knut deputy secretary-general Hesbon Otieno says the employer worked at the union&rsquo;s Homabay office. The incident happened just six days after the new leadership was elected into office, with reports indicating that it is increasingly becoming difficult for KNUT to meet its financial obligations due to reduced monthly union dues.
