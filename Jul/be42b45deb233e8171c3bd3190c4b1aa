Mageta island in the county of Siaya was a colonial prison for political detainees. Some notable names in Kenya&rsquo;s political history like Achieng Oneko had a stint in this island, as the colonial administration moved to suppress any form of political agitation. Now a fishing community, Mageta island has ironically remained a prison for the fisherfolk here, thanks to Ugandan authorities.
