The trial of Migori governor Okoth Obado and two others over the murder of university student Sharon Otieno which was scheduled to begin today will now kick off on Monday next week. The prosecution has lined up at least 35 witnesses in the case. And as KTN's Rita Tinina reports, high court judge Justice Cecilia Githua set the date after a virtual hearing in which the defense teams sought an adjournment citing the covid 19 containment measures affecting witnesses traveling from Migori one of the covid 19 hot spot counties.
