Bungoma County has been hospitalized after health workers downed their tools for non payment of their salaries for the last two months. The workers have vowed not to resume duties until their dues are paid. The striking health workers are among other things demanding adequate supply of protective gears as well as promotions. The delay in the payment of their salaries has been occasioned by failure by the county assembly of Bungoma to pass a supplementary budget.
