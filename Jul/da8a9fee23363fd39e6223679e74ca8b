On to the widening rift within the ruling jubilee party and Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui, is the latest jubilee party elected leader calling for an overhaul of the party leadership. He says some top leaders in the party including secretary general Raphael Tuju and vice chair David Murathe must go if the party is to regain its national appeal. Governor Kinyanjui, who is amongst president Uhuru's closest and most trusted ally within the party, has further revealed that the mess left in jubilee will only hurt loyal members who will be seeking elective positions in the 2022 elections.
