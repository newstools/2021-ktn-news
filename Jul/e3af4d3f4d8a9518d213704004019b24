President Uhuru Kenyatta will on Friday this week inspect two projects in the larger Ukambani region, a tour that has been scaled down from the earlier planned program. The president will inspect Konza city project as well as multi billion Thwake dam. The president's initial visit was rescheduled following supremacy battles between top Ukambani leaders. Today, wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka visited the two projects in preparations for the Friday president's tour.
