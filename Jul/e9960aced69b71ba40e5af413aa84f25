Corporal Caroline Jemutai Kangogo was today laid to rest at her parent's home in Nyawa village, Anin area, in the county of Elgeyo Marakwet. The late officer was not honoured with a police escort, casket watch or a guard of honour to celebrate her life as it is the norm when a member of the service or discipline forces dies. But as KTN&rsquo;s Elvis Kosgei reports, hundreds of mourners thronged her homestead to bid Caroline Kangogo farewell.
