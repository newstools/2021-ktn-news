There was drama at Iten county referral hospital morgue early today when the father of Caroline Jemutai Kangogo and other members of the family stormed the facility in an attempt to pick the body of their loved one. This was after the planned autopsy failed to take place as earlier planned throwing Saturday burial plans in disarray. Emotions ran high as family members protested the action by police not to conduct autopsy on the body of the late Kangogo who is scheduled to be buried tomorrow.
