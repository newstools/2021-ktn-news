The national treasury has kicked off preparations for the 2022/2023 budget four months early as it seeks to conclude the process before parliament breaks for the 2022 polls. In a public notice, treasury cabinet secretary Ukur Yatani invited the public to give proposals on next year's budget by the end of August 30, 2021, ahead of the usual November 30 deadline. The notice comes less than a month after the state started implementing the budget for the 2021/2022 financial year.
