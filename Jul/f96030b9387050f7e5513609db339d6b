Just how much do politicians spend to mount a serious campaign during elections in Kenya? And does a well-oiled campaign assure one of a win in an election? Well, a survey conducted by political experts shows that some potential contenders are being kept away due to the huge monies involved in campaigns. The survey conducted by prof. Karuti Kanyinga of the university of Nairobi and governance consultant Tom Mboya dubbed cost of politics in Kenya found out that the more one spent, the likelier they are to be elected. And as Fred Kagonye reports, this means that the cost of contesting in the 2022 polls is likely to be higher.
