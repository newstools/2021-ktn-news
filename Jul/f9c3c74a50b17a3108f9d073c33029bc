For the first time in the political tussle between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy President William Ruto, the second in command has now seemingly taken the fight to the president&rsquo;s doorstep. Thursday&rsquo;s parliamentary by-election in Kiambaa has been touted as a must-win contest for president Kenyatta's jubilee party. This is the first time the two are getting themselves in a direct political duel hence the high-stakes nature of the mini poll.
