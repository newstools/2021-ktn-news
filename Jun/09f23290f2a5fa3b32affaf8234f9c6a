The ministry of environment and natural resources has launched the Nairobi county environment sustainability & circular economy awareness campaign that advocates for the segregation of waste at source. Waste will no longer be generated and dumped but converted into more sustainable ways such as recycling, composting and other waste recovery initiatives. There will be waste transfer stations at Muthurwa market and another one at Kangundo road to ensure this. What cannot be recycled will be transported to Dandora. On an outlook basis, every sub-county will have a recovery facility. The Nairobi metropolitan service has tapped into community-based organizations within those areas to help in garbage collection.
