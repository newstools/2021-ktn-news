Meanwhile, former prime minister Raila Odinga has taken a swipe at former chief justice Dr. Willy Mutunga for criticizing president Uhuru Kenyatta over his failure to appoint the 4 judges and 2 magistrates recommended by judicial service commission. According to the ODM party leader, Mutunga has no locus standing to talk about justice and the rule of law yet he denied them justice in 2013 when he upheld the presidential win of president Uhuru Kenyatta during the presidential petition.
