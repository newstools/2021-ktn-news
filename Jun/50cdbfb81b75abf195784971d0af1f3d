Former ChiefJjustice &nbsp;Dr. Willy Mutunga has slammed president Uhuru Kenyatta, faulting him over his move to drop the names of 6 judges and magistrates. In a hard-hitting statement, Mutunga said the&nbsp;move by the President was egregious, reckless and insensitive advising the head of state&nbsp;to immediately appoint the remaining six Judges&nbsp;recommended by the judicial service commission, as required by the constitution. The former CJ was adamant that&nbsp;state offices are not personal property of any individual or office, and that all Kenyans have a right to seek to serve in the manner prescribed by law.
