Tonight, the row over who is boss in Wajir county continues to divide the leadership of the county. Members of the Wajir county assembly have told embattled Wajir governor Mohamed Abdi to stop misleading the public that he was the bonafide governor after a court ordered his reinstatement. The MCAs were reacting to a statement by Abdi to the effect that his impeachment by the assembly and the senate were null and void. And as Ahmed Hussein reports, the MCAs have also told the council of governors to keep off the affairs of Wajir.&nbsp;
