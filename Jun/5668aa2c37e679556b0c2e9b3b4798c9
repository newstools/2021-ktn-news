The independent electoral and boundaries commission selection panel has finally shortlisted 36 applicants from a list of 660 to be interviewed for the positions of IEBC commissioners. The 36 successful applicants will now have to forward their clearance certificates from the dci, high educations loans board, Kenya revenue authority and the ethics and anti?corruption commission before they are interviewed from the 7th of next month to the 22nd. And as Chris Thairu reports, majority of those shortlisted have served in various constitutional commissions as commissioners.
