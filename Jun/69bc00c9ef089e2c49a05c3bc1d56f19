Deputy President William Ruto Now seems to have adopted a new political strategy to counter his boss and former friend turned political foe President Uhuru Kenyatta. Whenever there is an altercation or a difference in opinion especially on political matters, the deputy president turns to his social media accounts especially his twitter handle to go bare knuckle with his boss. However, this plays differently when the two leaders share a podium, as the deputy president humbles himself before his boss. Communications Expert Barrack Muluka now says it is high time the deputy president come out in the open to faces his boss in person.
