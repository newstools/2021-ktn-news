Jubilee party will soon be holding party grassroot elections countrywide. According to party Secretary General Raphael Tuju, the elections will culminate in national elections. Tuju says the party is currently facing ethnic balkanization and defended himself against allegations that he is to blame for the woes currently afflicting the ruling party. Jubilee Vice Chair David Murathe has indicated that he is not interested in vying for any party position during the party polls.
