A total of 24 unclaimed bodies will be buried by the department of public health in Nakuru upon expiry of a 21-day period, in which their&nbsp;next of kin is required to pick them for burial. The bodies according to the public health officers have overstayed in mortuaries. According to the law,&nbsp;the public health department is allowed to dispose of unclaimed bodies after a period of time, but as Ibrahim Karanja reports, there are those that argue that this provision, if not regulated, may give clear and undetected getaways for criminals.
