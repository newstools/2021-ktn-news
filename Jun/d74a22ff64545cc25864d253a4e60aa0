And still on budget, Amani national congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has expressed concern&nbsp;over the 2021/22 financial year budget, proposed by treasury CS Ukur Yattani last week.&nbsp;Mudavadi says that the budget is a continuation of a familiar trend where populist measures override long term macroeconomic stability.&nbsp;Whilst faulting the ambitious budget, Mudavadi pointed out that having a 3 trillion-shilling budget against a tax revenue collection of 2 trillion shillings, only gave room for more borrowing further aggravating an already worse situation. &nbsp;
