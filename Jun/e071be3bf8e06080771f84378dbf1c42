The row over President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s decision to reject six judges nominated by the Judicial Service Commission has taken another twist after the high court barred any investigations or prosecution of the six who were not elevated on grounds of integrity issues. In his ruling, Justice James Makau also stopped the judicial service commission from taking any action on a report by the president giving reasons for the rejection of the six.
