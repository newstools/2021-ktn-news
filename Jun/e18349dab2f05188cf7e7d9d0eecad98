Rugby legend Benjamin Ayimba was on Friday laid to rest at an emotional ceremony in his Uranga home in Siaya county.&nbsp;The ceremony that was supervised by a battalion of police officers to keep mourner&rsquo;s numbers in check attracted several past and present rugby players.&nbsp;Kenyarugby union director Hilary Atila said the union was in talks with the family to establish how the late Ayimba can be immortalized given his contribution to the game both as a player and coach.
