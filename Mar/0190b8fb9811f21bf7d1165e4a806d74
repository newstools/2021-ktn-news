Drama ensued at Nuu Anglican church in the county of Kitui after area police ordered congregants out of the church midway through the service attended by area politicians, among them Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua. The congregants were ordered out for allegedly contravening ministry of health covid containment protocols. Politicians now seem to be trooping to churches after president Uhuru Kenyatta banned political rallies for the next 30 days.
