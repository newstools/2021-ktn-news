Many places of worship in Nairobi and Nakuru remained deserted during the Palm Sunday celebrations following the directive that they should not exceed a third of their full capacity. In other places like Meru and Uasin Gishu, church services were conducted in strict conformity with the covid19 protocols as the clergy have now resorted to segmenting the church services. This, as the country, recorded 884 new coronavirus infections from a sample size of 5,377.
