The clamor for constitutional reforms through&nbsp;the building bridges initiative, BBI, has taken a rather interesting twist courtesy of the coronavirus pandemic. Kakamega governor, who is also the orange democratic movement, ODM, deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya now says that it is no longer tenable for the country to hold a constitutional referendum before the 2022 general election. Oparanya says that the harsh economic times brought about by covid?19 containment measures make a referendum unjustifiable, and that money set aside for the BBI should be used to fight the virus.
