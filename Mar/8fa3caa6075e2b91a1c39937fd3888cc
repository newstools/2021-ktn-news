a clash looms between president Uhuru Kenyatta and former prime minister Raila Odinga in Kisii, where jubilee and ODM are fielding candidates for the Bonchari parliamentary byelection. This emerged as jubilee also issued nomination certificates to former Garissa senator Yusuf haji's son Abdul haji to run for senator, and Susan njeri widow of the late juja legislator Francis waititu, to fly the party's flag in the May 18th parliamentary byelection.
