Tonight, President Uhuru Kenyatta has placed the counties of Nairobi, Machakos, Kiambu, Nakuru and Kajiado under lockdown after they were individually and collectively declared a covid-19 infected zone. The five counties were indefinitely put under cessation of all movement by road, rail, or air, effective mid night tonight. All public gatherings and in person meetings in the five counties have also been suspended indefinitely. However, people will move freely within the five counties since they were locked as one zoned area. KTN senior political reporter Patrick Amimo begins our coverage tonight
