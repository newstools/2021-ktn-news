Kenyans will pay even more for fuel. The energy and petroleum regulatory authority has revised fuel prices upwards once again, a move that Kenyans are crying foul about. Fuel prices in the country have been on an upward trend since December last year. Petrol has increased by 15 shillings; diesel has gone up by 10 shillings while kerosene has gone up by 13 shillings since December last year.
