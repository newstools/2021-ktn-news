A senior officer from the national land commission who went missing on Friday has been found dead. The body of Jennifer Wambua who was set to appear in court on Wednesday for cross-examination in an ongoing case involving a government agency was discovered at the city mortuary this afternoon and was identified by the husband. As KTN senior reporter Duncan Khaemba tells us, a few days ago, the late Wambua was involved in a road accident between Chumvi and Machakos town and the family through Makueni MP Dan Maanzo wants detectives handling the matter to thoroughly scrutinize her phone to establish her latest contacts before she went missing.
