George Koimburi of the little-known people&rsquo;s empowerment party is the member of parliament elect for the Juja constituency. He caused a major upset for the ruling party jubilee after garnering 12,159 votes against jubilee's Susan Waititu who got less than half of that 5,746 votes. Koimburi whose party is associated with Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria now replaces the late Francis Munyua who died earlier in the year. And as George Maringa reports, OODM and UDA shared the spoils in the just concluded by-elections.
