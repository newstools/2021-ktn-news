There was a major security lapse after a man jumped on the road and blocked president Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s official car in the lucky summer area, here in Nairobi. the unidentified man is seen standing by the roadside as the president&rsquo;s convoy drove by and unexpectedly charged towards the moving convoy just as the security lead car drove past a handful of bystanders bringing the president&rsquo;s car to a stop. he was then forced off the road by security. our senior reporter Rita Tinina reports on the unimaginable move in lucky summer that came a few days after another in Lamu county a few days ago.
