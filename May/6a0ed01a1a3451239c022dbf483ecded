Safaricom has made an entry into the Ethiopian market. This after the country awarded a new telecommunication license to a consortium made up of Safaricom and Vodafone group. The move now paves the way for outside investors to enter the huge market. The two companies will invest 805 billion dollars in their network over the next 10 years. The Ethiopian government has also called off the sale of a second new permit but will invite fresh bids from international wireless carriers after some policy adjustments.
