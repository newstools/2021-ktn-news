The family of five persons who perished in a road crash on the Taru Samburu road on Saturday are now appealing for financial assistance to transport bodies of the deceased upcountry for burial. The deceased identified as Erick Otieno, his wife and three children died on the spot as several others sustained serious injuries. This as the BMW club, family members and friends of the late Allan Ngugi visited the accident scene on Nairobi&rsquo;s southern bypass to pay their tributes. And as Ktn&rsquo;s Allan Ochanda now reports, the meteorological department has issued a warning to motorists against driving in moving waters on the roads.
