A plot is being hatched by a section of politicians to impeach interior and national coordination Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang&rsquo;i over the manner he is conducting his official duties. The plan has been mooted by some leaders from both the government and the opposition. The grounds to impeach Matiang&rsquo;i is coming from the recent by-elections in which he is being accused of misusing the police. Among those who have complained against Matiang&rsquo;i is ODM leader Raila Odinga as well as IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati.
