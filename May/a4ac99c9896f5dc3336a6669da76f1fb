The installation of National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi as the region's spokesperson has elicited mixed reactions across the political divide as well as in the Kikuyu Council of Elders fraternity. This is a clear indication it will not be a walk in the park for Speaker Justin Muturi as he embarks on his new role as Mt. Kenya spokesman. But just why did the Kikuyu elders insist on installing Muturi as The Mt Kenya Spokesman? Could this be the first step of political negotiations for the region and is Muturi the right man to propel the region into the next political bargain?
