One of the main proponents and initiator of the BBI process Raila Odinga has said they will be moving to the court of appeal to appeal the BBi verdict by a five?judge bench. Raila in a statement said he was disappointed with the ruling by the judges but called for restraint among supporters of the BBI. Speaking two days after the landmark ruling,&nbsp;Raila said the judiciary as one arm of the government must be respected and that no one should make personalized attacks on the judges. President Uhuru Kenyatta is yet to respond.&nbsp;
