Senior Sergeant Grace Nyamohanga, also known as &lsquo;Nasra&rsquo;, the prison warder believed to be in charge of a syndicate that has swindled Kenyans millions of shillings, has surrendered to the directorate of criminal investigations. The suspect appeared before the DCI serious crimes unit investigators on Sunday morning. She is expected to help the police with investigations into a 200 million shillings&rsquo; fake job racket. The 50-year-old officer was detained and will be arraigned to answer to charges.
